Freelancing Management System
Project Description
The Freelancing Management System is a basic desktop application developed using C++. It is designed to help freelancers efficiently create their profiles and accept jobs that only match with their niche. The system is focused on simplicity, allowing freelancers to manage their work with ease. It does not support bidding or complex project negotiation, making it ideal for freelancers who need a streamlined approach to managing their business.

Features:
Profile Management: Ability to create freelancer and client profiles.
Simple UI: Text-based user interface that is easy to navigate.
No Bidding System: Unlike most freelancing platforms, this system focuses on task and project management without bidding functionality.
